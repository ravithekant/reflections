What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A directory of name .git is created. This directory contains all the metadata
	about this repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is those collections of files in the working directory whose 
	changes will reflect on next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	As soon as a change is added to staging area, I will commit the change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

	Whenever there is some feature that I want to add but it should not roll out
	to all the users, branching is helpful.
