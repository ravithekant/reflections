When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    If want some other contributors taht can help me, I will use a remote repository. 
    Or if I want to do an open source project, it will be helpful.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	A change made in remote repository may not be always relevant to my project or my target.
	So manual pull is the way to go rather than automatic pull.
