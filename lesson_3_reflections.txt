When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If want some other contributors taht can help me, I will use a remote repository. 
    Or if I want to do an open source project, it will be helpful.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	A change made in remote repository may not be always relevant to my project or my target.
	So manual pull is the way to go rather than automatic pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is cloning an existing repository from github on github. Clone is cloning an existing github
	repository as a local repository on computer. Branching is creating a new branch of the existing
	repository to add an experimental feature. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	By having a last known state of remote stored locally, we can know how much changes are made locally.
	This will also help in solving conflict merges.
